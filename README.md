# blackhole_nexus_honeypot

Blackhole Nexus is an advanced honeypot detection system. The primary goal of this project is to explore the role of honeypots in modern threat detection, honeypot data analysis, and threat intelligence enrichment. By simulating vulnerable systems, Blackhole Nexus is designed to attract and deceive attackers, offering valuable insights into their tactics and methodologies while protecting critical network resources.

Honeypots serve as a proactive measure in cybersecurity by luring attackers into controlled environments where their actions can be closely monitored. This approach allows defenders to gather critical data on the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, without risking real systems or data. Blackhole Nexus integrates several types of honeypots, including SSH, Telnet, SMB, and WebDAV, and supports various security features such as syscall hooks, threat intelligence integration, and automated logging. The system also includes an intuitive command-line interface for managing honeypots and reviewing captured data.

Honeypots are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for improving threat detection and response, particularly in the context of Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) and cyber threat intelligence (CTI). By capturing and analyzing data from honeypots, security teams can enhance their understanding of attacker behavior and improve their defensive strategies. Blackhole Nexus contributes to this field by providing a fully functional, research-focused honeypot system that can be easily extended and customized to meet specific security needs.

Features
Multiple Honeypot Types: Includes Cowrie SSH and Telnet honeypots, as well as custom SMB and WebDAV honeypots.

Threat Intelligence Integration: Integrates with external threat intelligence sources like AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal for IP reputation and file analysis.

Syscall Monitoring: Hooks into system calls on both Linux and Windows to observe malicious behavior in real-time.

Automated Logging and Parsing: Centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for real-time analysis of interactions.

Custom CLI Honeypot Controller: Easy-to-use terminal interface for managing honeypots and reviewing logs.

LaTeX Reporting: Automatically generates detailed PDF reports on honeypot activity and attacker interactions.

Research and Purpose
The Blackhole Nexus honeypot system was created with the primary aim of investigating the practical applications of honeypots in real-world threat detection. As cyber threats continue to evolve, traditional defense mechanisms such as firewalls and antivirus software are often not enough to prevent sophisticated attacks. Honeypots offer a unique solution by simulating vulnerable systems that can be used to deceive and study attackers in a safe environment. This research explores how honeypots can be used to gather valuable threat intelligence and enhance overall security posture.

By leveraging Blackhole Nexus, security professionals and researchers can gain a deeper understanding of attacker tactics and use this information to improve network defenses. The system also demonstrates how honeypots can be integrated into broader cybersecurity frameworks, such as Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), to enhance detection capabilities and mitigate potential risks.
