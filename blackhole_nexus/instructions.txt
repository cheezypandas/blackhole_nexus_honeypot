Steps to Start the Blackhole Nexus Honeypot System (WSL Setup)
==============================================================

0. Open your WSL terminal.
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip git curl

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd "/mnt/host/c/users/sandi/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub Projects/blackhole_nexus"

2. Refresh the docker:
   docker compose -f honeypots/cowrie/docker-compose.yml down
   docker compose -f honeypots/cowrie/docker-compose.yml up -d

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   source venv_linux/bin/activate

4. (Optional but recommended) Install project requirements:
  pip install -r requirements.txt


5. Run the main honeypot controller UI:
   python cli.py

6. In the UI, use the number keys to:
   [1] Start all honeypots
   [2] Stop all honeypots
   [3] View live logs
   [4] Generate PDF report
   [5] Open settings (future feature)
   [Q] Quit
7. Install WSL
   If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you may need to    install it. Run the following command:

   sudo apt install wsl

8. Fix Line-Endings in the setup.sh Script
   If you encounter a bad interpreter: No such file or directory error due to Windows-style line endings in the setup.sh script, run this command to fix it:

   sed -i 's/\r$//' setup.sh

9. Make the Script Executable
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh

10. Install flask after opening virtual environment.
    source venv/bin/activate  # Or whatever your venv is called
    pip install flask

Notes:
------
- Make sure Docker is running in the background on your Windows host.
- Ensure your WSL has access to Docker by configuring it properly (e.g., Docker Desktop WSL integration enabled).
- If you run into port binding issues, verify no other service is using those ports (2222, 445, 8080).
